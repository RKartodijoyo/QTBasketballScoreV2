the music panel is extra  time for this. and if you build your project dont forget folder music must be in the same place in execute file.
when you build in windows maybe you must configure from QDIR file path

why i dont embed the music in the software because when i build then make my computer freeze because this eat my ram and make erro this say exhausted virtual memory, so i decided make music file out ffrom program. 

thanks before just enjoy it
